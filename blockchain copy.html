        <p>A <b>blockchain</b> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger"target="_blank">distributed ledger</a> with growing <del>lists</del> steps of records
            (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes.<sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup> Each block
            contains a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography"target="_blank">cryptographic</a> hash of the previous block, a<mark>timestamp</mark>, and transaction
            data (generally represented as a <mark>Merkle tree</mark>, where <mark>data nodes</mark> are represented by
            leaves). Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain
            (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it.
            Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any
            given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.

            <br> Blockchains are typically managed by a <mark>peer-to-peer (P2P)</mark> computer network for use as a
            public <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger"target="_blank">distributed ledger</a>, where nodes collectively adhere to a <mark>consensus algorithm
                protocol</mark> to add and validate new transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not
            unalterable, since <mark>blockchain forks</mark> are possible, blockchains may be considered <mark>secure by
                design</mark> and exemplify a distributed computing system with high <mark>Byzantine fault
                tolerance</mark>.<sup>[5]</sup>

            <br> A blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name (or pseudonym) <mark>Satoshi
                Nakamoto</mark> in 2008 to serve as the <mark>public distributed ledger</mark> for<mark> bitcoin
                cryptocurrency transactions</mark>, based on previous work by<mark>Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta, and
                Dave Bayer</mark> .<sup>[6]</sup> The implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin made it the first
            digital currency to solve the <mark>double-spending problem</mark> without the need for a<mark> trusted
                authority or central server</mark>. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications<sup>[3][2]</sup>
            and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used by <mark>cryptocurrencies</mark>. The
            blockchain may be considered a type of payment rail.<sup>[7]</sup>

    <p>Cryptographer <mark>David</mark> Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation
        "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups."<sup>[10]</sup> Further
        work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by <mark>Stuart Haber</mark> and
        <mark>W. Scott Stornetta</mark>.<sup>[4][11]</sup> They wanted to implement a system wherein document timestamps
        could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design,
        which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.[4][12]
        Under their company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been published in The New York Times every
        week since 1995.<sup>[13]</Sup>

        <br> The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi
        Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to timestamp
        blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to
        stabilize the rate at which blocks are added to the chain.[4] The design was implemented the following year by
        Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all
        transactions on the network.<Sup>[3]</Sup>

        <br> In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred
        on the network, reached 20 GB (gigabytes).<sup>[14]</sup> In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB,
        and from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size. The ledger size
        had exceeded 200 GB by early 2020.<sup>[15]</sup>

        <br> The words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper, but were eventually
        popularized as a single word, blockchain, by 2016.<sup>[16]</sup>

    <h2>Structure and design</h2>

        alt="tis is a image of structure and design">
    <p>A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and often public, digital ledger consisting of records called
        blocks that are used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be altered
        retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.<sup>[3][20]</sup> This allows the participants
        to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.[21] A blockchain database is
        managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server. They are authenticated
        by mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests.<sup>[22]</sup> Such a design facilitates robust
        workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes
        the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was
        transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double-spending. A blockchain has been described as
        a value-exchange protocol.<sup>[23]</sup> A blockchain can maintain title rights because, when properly set up
        to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.[citation needed]</p>
    </br>
    <p>Logically, a blockchain can be seen as consisting of several layers:<sup>[24]</sup></p>
    <p>
        <li>infrastructure (hardware)</li>
        <br>
        <li>networking (node discovery, information propagation<sup>[25]</sup> and verification)</li>
        <br>
        <li>consensus (proof of work, proof of stake)</li>
        <br>
        <li>data (blocks, transactions)</li>
        <br>
        <li>application (smart contracts/decentralized applications, if applicable)</li>
    </p>

    <h2><b>Blocks</b></h2>
    <p>Blocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into a Merkle tree.[3] Each block includes
        the cryptographic hash of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks form a chain.[3]
        This iterative process confirms the integrity of the previous block, all the way back to the initial block,
        which is known as the genesis block (Block 0).[26][27] To assure the integrity of a block and the data contained
        in it, the block is usually digitally signed.[28]
        <br>
        <br>Sometimes separate blocks can be produced concurrently, creating a temporary fork. In addition to a secure
        hash-based history, any blockchain has a specified algorithm for scoring different versions of the history so
        that one with a higher score can be selected over others. Blocks not selected for inclusion in the chain are
        called orphan blocks.[27] Peers supporting the database have different versions of the history from time to
        time. They keep only the highest-scoring version of the database known to them. Whenever a peer receives a
        higher-scoring version (usually the old version with a single new block added) they extend or overwrite their
        own database and retransmit the improvement to their peers. There is never an absolute guarantee that any
        particular entry will remain in the best version of history forever. Blockchains are typically built to add the
        score of new blocks onto old blocks and are given incentives to extend with new blocks rather than overwrite old
        blocks. Therefore, the probability of an entry becoming superseded decreases exponentially[29] as more blocks
        are built on top of it, eventually becoming very low.[3][30]: ch. 08 [31] For example, bitcoin uses a
        proof-of-work system, where the chain with the most cumulative proof-of-work is considered the valid one by the
        network. There are a number of methods that can be used to demonstrate a sufficient level of computation. Within
        a blockchain the computation is carried out redundantly rather than in the traditional segregated and parallel
        manner.[32]
    </p>
    <h2><b>Block Time</b></h2>
    <p>The block time is the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra block in the blockchain. By the
        time of block completion, the included data becomes verifiable. In cryptocurrency, this is practically when the
        transaction takes place, so a shorter block time means faster transactions. The block time for Ethereum is set
        to between 14 and 15 seconds, while for bitcoin it is on average 10 minutes.[33]

    </p>
    <h2><b>Hard Fork</b></h2>
    <p><i>This section is an excerpt from Fork (blockchain) § Hard fork.</i></p>
    <p>A hard fork is a change to the blockchain protocol that is not backward compatible and requires all users to
        upgrade their software in order to continue participating in the network. In a hard fork, the network splits
        into two separate versions: one that follows the new rules and one that follows the old rules.
        <br>
        <br>For example, Ethereum was hard forked in 2016 to "make whole" the investors in The DAO, which had been
        hacked by exploiting a vulnerability in its code. In this case, the fork resulted in a split creating Ethereum
        and Ethereum Classic chains. In 2014 the Nxt community was asked to consider a hard fork that would have led to
        a rollback of the blockchain records to mitigate the effects of a theft of 50 million NXT from a major
        cryptocurrency exchange. The hard fork proposal was rejected, and some of the funds were recovered after
        negotiations and ransom payment. Alternatively, to prevent a permanent split, a majority of nodes using the new
        software may return to the old rules, as was the case of bitcoin split on 12 March 2013.[34]
        <br>
        <br> A more recent hard-fork example is of Bitcoin in 2017, which resulted in a split creating Bitcoin Cash.[35]
        The network split was mainly due to a disagreement in how to increase the transactions per second to accommodate
        for demand.[36]
